### Rules and flows of the app:
- When creating the individual goal, it must be sent for approval by the immediate superior.
- An email flow is triggered at the end of each step.
- Only the immediate superior can create/edit department goals. Employees can view them.
- Goals can only be created/edited/deleted within the active period of the French year.
- Once the goal is approved/saved and sent, the original goal cannot be modified.
- Only the immediate superior can fill in the goal's result.

### Step-by-step:

1. After filling out the individual goals, the employee must click the "SEND FOR VALIDATION" button to send it to the immediate superior.
